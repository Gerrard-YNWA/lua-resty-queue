### new

`syntax: q, err = queue:new([option:table])`

- `option:table`
  - `capacity`: number (optional) - capacity for the ring buffer default `1024`
  - `blocked`: boolean (optional) - whether the queue is a blocked queue
  - `timeout`: number (optional) - seconds for waiting semaphore default 3 while specified a blocked queue, notice that if the queue is not a blocked queue, this option has no effect.
